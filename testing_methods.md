Testing Methods:

      -Zone: 
            -External : When we say that we perform the process externally on a website, it means that we come out of the desired site and perform the process on the organization.

            -Interal : When we say that we want to do a process internally on a website, it means that we go inside that site and do all the steps from inside that site.


      -Connection:
            -Active : When we say that we are actively interacting with a site and we see its index, it means that our log falls on that site and we have a direct connection with that site.

            -Passive : When we say that we passively interact with a site and see its index, it means that our log does not fall on that site and we do not have a direct connection with that site.
