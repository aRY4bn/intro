-Proof of Concept (PoC):

A Proof of Concept (PoC) in pentesting is a demonstration that verifies the existence of a vulnerability by showing how it can be exploited. 
The PoC is designed to be a safe and controlled way to illustrate the risk without causing harm to the system.


-Reporting:

The report in pentesting is a comprehensive document that details the findings of the penetration test. 
It includes information on the identified vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and recommendations for remediation.
